## Weather and climate models

$$
\frac{Du}{Dt}+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\part p}{\part x}-fv=\mathcal{F}_x
$$

$$
\frac{Dv}{Dt}+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\part p}{\part y}+fu=\mathcal{F}_y
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\part p}{\part z}+g=0
$$

- weather prediction by numerical process
  - imagine a large hall like a theatre
- the walls of this chamber are painted to form a map of the globe
- Myriad computers are at work upon the weather
- 64000 computers would be needed to race the weather for the whole globe

## What cambridge are doing in the climate science related research

- datawave
  - Use ML to develop **data-driven gravity wave (GW) parameterizations**
  - to more accurate and efficiently represent GW momentum fluxes
  - challenge
    - fast inter language interoperation (Python-Fortran)
- sasip
  - Use ML to develop scale aware continuum sea ice model
  - that faithfully represents sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics
  - challenge
    - parallelisation strategies including land mask
- lemontree
  - Develop next-generation model of the **terrestrial biosphere**
  - its interactions with the carbon cycle 
  - water cycle and climate
  - challenges
    - new Python model 
    - Backlog unprocessed data
    - (Fluent)
- M2LinES
  - Use scientific and interpretable ML to capture unaccounted physical processes at coupled air sea ice interface

## Four examples

- Sea ice forecast
  - CNNs out performs dynamical forecast and linear trend at lead of 2 months and above
- heatwave forecast
  - combine past observations and climate simulations to improve forecasts of extremes
- Ocean forecast
  - explore physical basis for data-driven models
- hydrological forecast
  - improve flood

## Example 1: seasonal sea ice forecast

- background
  - arctic sea has a strong season cycle 
  - also a strong downward trend over recent decades
  - currently physics-based dunamical models and simple statistical forecasts
- goal
  - forecast sea ice for next six months using data driven deep learning approach
  - has implications for NH
- Approach
  - Input
    - sea ice concentration
    - SIC
    - 11 climae variable variables
    - statistical SIC forecast
      - 50 channel input to ensemble of U-Net networks
  - task
    - classification into open water
    - SIX <= 15% 
    - marginal ice
      - 15% < SIX < 

## Example 2: heatwave forecast

- goal
  - generate city scale projections of 
  - Extreme temperature by postprocessing
  - climate model simulation at specific location that can then be used to access risk through supply chains
  - transport routes
  - labour productivity 
  - infrastructure 
  - transport
  - mortability all impacted by extreme heat
- challenge
  - raw output from climate model

- input

$$
T, S, \underline{u}, 
$$

## Example 4 hydrological forecast

$$
Y=f(\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_n, \psi_1, \psi_2, \psi_3)
$$

## Extend further to account for correlated risk and map to data on impacts

- Cairo on verge of energy crisis
  - what will future demand be for air conditioning?
  - How will this impact the energy network?
- Design regulations for
  - Sustainable urban dranage
  - thermal comfort in buildings
- How volunerable is a country or system to climate disruptions
